# PROJECT_PASSWORD_INPUT

## This project is made to help people verify their passwords and make sure they are secure. It can be used for anything from a website to a mobile app.

## The code is written in HTML5 , CSS3 , JS and can be found in my GitHub repository.


## The project consists of a simple user interface that asks for the user's password. The user can type his password

## The user interface connects to a server that checks the security of the password. The server checks the length of the password, whether the password is in a list of common passwords, and whether the password has at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one number.

## If the password is secure, the server returns a green result and if it is not, it returns a red result.

## This project is useful for people who want to make sure their passwords are secure. It can also be useful for developers.
